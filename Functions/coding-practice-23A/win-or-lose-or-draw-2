# def compare(team_a_points, team_b_points):: This line defines the function compare that takes two integer parameters team_a_points and team_b_points.

# if team_a_points > team_b_points:: Inside the function, it checks if team_a_points is greater than team_b_points.

# return "Win": If team_a_points is greater, the function returns the string "Win".

# elif team_a_points == team_b_points:: If team_a_points is not greater than team_b_points, it checks if both points are equal using the elif (else if) statement.

# return "Draw": If both points are equal, the function returns the string "Draw".

# elif team_a_points < team_b_points:: If team_a_points is neither greater nor equal to team_b_points, it assumes that team_a_points is less than team_b_points using another elif statement.

# return "Lose": If team_a_points is less than team_b_points, the function returns the string "Lose".

# team_a_points = int(input()) and team_b_points = int(input()): These lines prompt the user to input the points for two teams and store them in variables team_a_points and team_b_points, respectively.

# compare_result = compare(team_a_points, team_b_points): This line calls the compare function with the input points as arguments and stores the resulting comparison result in the variable compare_result.

# print(compare_result): Finally, the code prints the comparison result, which can be "Win", "Draw", or "Lose" based on the points of the two teams.

# For example, if the user inputs 3 for team_a_points and 2 for team_b_points, the code will print Win, indicating that team_a_points (3) is greater than team_b_points (2).
